Journal Entry #1
Muahahah! I've done it! After all those years of stalking I finally managed to capture...HER! My sweet princess! Now I shall set about wooing her with my boyish charm and Mama's secret SPACE PAD THAI! It's foolproof! All I have to do now is sit back, and wait for the Spaceholm Syndrome to kick in! We'll be ruling the galaxy together in no time! 

Journal Entry #2
CURSES! My foolproof plan! FOOLED! How was I supposed to know she was allergic to space peanuts!? I thought she avoided them because they're empty calories! Now all I have to show for my brilliant plan is a corpse and some cold Space Pad Thai...cold like the emptiness of my souuuuuul.

Journal Entry #3
Ohohoho! I've figured it out, diary! A fix for my problem! I'LL JUST CLONE MYSELF A NEW PRINCESS! It'll be even better than the original, I can put my clones through a gauntlet of danger to make sure I have the BEST of the BEST as my Queen! Space Orc doesn't seem very on board, but I'm not paying him to mumble about "nuclaic degradation" and "loss of DNA integrity": I'm paying him to pull that lever! 

WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG!?
